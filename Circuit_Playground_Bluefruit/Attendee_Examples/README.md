## Attendee Examples

Thank you for participating in our Open Spaces or Sprints! If you write up a demo that you'd like to share, this is the place to do it!

Please submit your demo through a pull request using GitHub (and Git). Your example should be in its own directory inside this directory. For example, if you wrote a demo called fun_game.py, the directory structure including the file should be:

`../Attendee_Examples/Fun_Game/fun_game.py`

Feel free to include a README.md file if you would like to do so.
