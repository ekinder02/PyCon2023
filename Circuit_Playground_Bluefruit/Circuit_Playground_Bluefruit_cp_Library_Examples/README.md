# PyCon 2023 Circuit Playground Bluefruit Circuit Playground Library Examples

This directory contains examples for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit using the Circuit Playground
library. This library handles all the hardware set up for you so you can quickly get going with
all sorts of different demos. These examples cover most of the features of the library, with
both simple one-feature demos and more complicated demos that combine features.

To check out examples that _don't_ use the Circuit Playground library, check out the
`Circuit_Playground_Bluefruit_Examples` directory in this repository.
