# PyCon 2023 Circuit Playground Bluefruit Examples

The examples in this directory are longer-form code that includes all necessary hardware set up.
The Circuit Playground library does all of that set up in the background. These examples do not
use the Circuit Playground library to show how the basic features of the CPB would be handled when
setting up the hardware "manually".

To check out examples that _do_ use the Circuit Playground library, check out the
`Circuit_Playground_Bluefruit_cp_Library_Examples` directory in this repository.
